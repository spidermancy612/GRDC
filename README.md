# Strikedown Protocol
## GAME Project

GRDC Game Project for the 2017 year

A turn-based space combat game played from a top-down perspective.
-   Turns are resolved simutaneously
-   Networked multiplayer between 2 to 4 players
-   Actions available to a player will be determined randomly through a card draw system

Gameplay
-
In each round, each player will draw seven cards. Each round has three phases, with three cards being played in the first phase, three cards being played in the second phase, and the final card being saved for the last phase. Card chances are reset after each round.

Each player plans their turn and then lets the next player plan their turn. When all players have finished, their turns will all play out at the same time. It is important to note that the turns are simply pauses in a perpetual environment. This will be explained further after card types are discussed.

Card Draw
-
The actions available to each player are determined by a card draw system. The card types are as follows: Move; Weak Move; Strong Move; Attack; Shield. The planned odds for these cards are as follows: 12/42; 6/42; 8/42; 10/42; 6/42.
